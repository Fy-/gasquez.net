## About me

Full stack developer, I’m in love with computer engineering since 1990. I’m working
freelance most of the time and I also take time to contribute to Open Source projects. I
worked on a lot of different software/app/websites gaining programming skills in **Go**, **Python**, **Flask**, **SQLAlchemy**, sockets, **C#**, SQL, as well as front end HTML and CSS. I also made a lot of small fun games using **Unity** and C#.
