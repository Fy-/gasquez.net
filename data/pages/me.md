freelance most of the time and I also take time to contribute to Open Source projects. 

I worked on a lot of different software/app/websites gaining programming skills in **Go**, **Python**, **Flask**, **SQLAlchemy**, **C#**, sockets, SQL, as well as front end HTML and CSS. I also made a lot of small fun games using **Unity** and C#.
